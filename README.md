# Solar System

### Level 0

Students will work with table views, learn about protocols, and implement the UITableViewDataSource and UITableViewDelegate protocols to build a Solar System directory.

Students who complete this project independently are able to:

* instantiate and place a UITableView on the screen
* work with UITableViewControllers
* implement a master-detail interface
* implement the UITableViewDataSource protocol
* use the UITableViewDelegate protocol methods to respond to user interaction
* instantiate and place UIImages on the screen
* use a Model Object Controller to access model objects

## Guide

### Master List View

Build a view that lists the planets using a `UITableViewController` scene. Implement the `UITableViewDataSource` protocol methods (refer to the documentation for a refresher if needed). Note than one could use a `UIViewController` with a `UITableView` placed on it, but `UITableViewController` implements a full screen `UITableView` by default, and comes with other benefits discussed in the lesson.

<summary><code> Step by step process:</code></summary>

1. Add a UITableViewController as your root view controller in Main.storyboard and embed it into a UINavigationController
2. Create a PlanetListViewController file as a subclass of UITableViewController and set the class of your root view controller scene
3. Implement the UITableViewDataSource methods using the PlanetController.planets array
   * note: Pay attention to your `reuseIdentifier` in the Storyboard scene and your dequeue function call
4. Set up your cells to display the name, image, and index of the planet Note: Normal cell styles have a `UIImageView` by default.
 <details>
   <summary><code> Hint:</code> </summary>
    Look at the included properties and various styles of a UITableViewCell
 </details>

5. Feel free to experiment with the content modes on the cell's UIImageView to display the image in different ways
</details>

The `UITableViewController` subclass template comes with a lot of boilerplate and commented code. For readability, please remove all unused boilerplate from your code.
### Detail View

Build a `UIViewController` scene in the storyboard that has UI elements to display an image of the planet and the details of a planet, such as **distance from the sun**, **day length**, and **diameter**. Make a `planet` variable for the tableViewController's `prepare(for segue: ...)` function to pass the planet that is tapped on. Create and call a function that updates the UI elements to display the information from the `planet` variable.

<details>
<summary><code> Step by step process:</code></summary>

1. Add a new `UIViewController` scene to Main.storyboard
2. Create a `PlanetDetailViewController` file as a subclass of `UIViewController` and set the class of your detail view scene
<details>
 <summary><code> Hint:</code> </summary>
 In the Main.storyboard, click the yellow circle above the new UIViewController scene, then select the Identity Inspector (the third icon from the right) on the top right of the window. In the text field that says "Class:", type the name of the new `UIViewController` subclass you just made in the previous step (`PlanetDetailViewController`)
</details>

3. Add a UIImageView and UILabels to display the data
   * note: Experiment with Autolayout automatic constraints or UIStackViews to create an appealing detail view
4. Create outlets from the UIImageView and UILabels to your `PlanetDetailViewController` class
<details>
<summary> <code> If Xcode won't let you create the outlets: </code> </summary>
 Make sure that you've correctly set the class of the detail view scene from the last step.
</details>

5. Add an optional `planet` property (of type `Planet`) that will be set by the Master List View when performing the segue
6. Add a new function called `updateViews` that makes sure a planet was successfully passed to the `PlanetDetailViewController`'s planet property made in step 5 by unwrapping it, then updates the view controller's title, UIImageView and UILabels with the planet's data
   * note: This is an extremely common design pattern. Commit it to memory. If you have a detail view or table view cell template that displays data, use an 'updateViews' method takes the model data passed from the previous view controller's `prepareForSegue` function, and updates the view's subviews with it.
7. Update the `viewDidLoad()` function to call the `updateViews` function.

</details>

You can test your view and the update function by setting the detail view as the initial view controller, then in the `viewDidLoad`, assign `self.planet` to `PlanetController.planets[0]`, before calling `updateViews` Be sure to reverse those changes when done checking that the view works, or you may have undesired behavior as you create your segue, though make sure to leave the `updateViews` function in the `viewDidLoad`.

### Segue

Create a segue between your List View and Detail View that will pass the selected planet to the detail view for display.


<details>
<summary><code> Step by step process:</code></summary>

1. Option-drag from your prototype cell in the List View to the Detail View to create a "show" segue.
2. Select the segue and give it an identifier
   * note: As a matter of best practice, the identifier should describe what the segue does, for example `toPlanetDetail`
3. Add the `prepareForSegue` function to your `PlanetListViewController` class
   * note: Remember that `prepareForSegue` will get called on all segues triggered from the current scene and accompanying view controller class
4. Implement the `prepareForSegue` method. by checking for the correct segue identifier, capturing an instance of the selected planet, capturing an instance of the `PlanetDetailViewController`, and setting the `planet` property of the `PlanetDetailViewController`
   <details>
</summary> Hint: </code> </summary>
   * note: Remember, the `PlanetDetailViewController` will use the `planet` property to update itself when it loads to display to the user
</details>

### Black Diamonds

* Add additional model data to the Planet class, update the PlanetController to include it, and update the PlanetDetailViewController to display it
* Add an image of the entire Solar System as a header view to the list UITableView
* Create a Unit or UITest that verifies the number of cells in the PlanetListViewController
* Create a Unit or UITest that verifies the values of PlanetController.planets
